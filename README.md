# Project Name
U-Grid
## Description
U-GRID was iherited from public repository https://github.com/QianyeYang/mpmrireg, adding U-Grid to the original repos.
U-GRID employs a Unifying Projection technique to map complex 3D features into a 1D vector, effectively reducing computational overhead while maintaining essential spatial details. This innovative projection transforms a traditionally complex task into a more manageable 1D regression problem. U-GRID employs these 1D vectors to compute a grid-regulated deformation field. This approach enables precise control with fewer control points. Both approaches enhance the efficiency and accuracy of the image registration process.
